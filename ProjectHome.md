This project contains the ROS package drone\_detection for location landlines using the bottom camera of the AR Drone 2.0.

The package has been developed in Pontificia Javeriana University by Juan Pablo Rodr√≠guez and Carolina Castiblanco.

The system is composed by two main algorithms detection and record. The former develops the detection process and the latter creates a video file using the obtained images of UAV. The images with landmines  and the recorded video are saved in "minas" and "video" folders of package respectively.

In addition on the repository, the users can find differents worlds of simulation developed  in the landmine\_zone\_gazebo package. The simulation enviroments depend of the tum\_simulator package for add the AR Drone 2.0 model to the worlds.
